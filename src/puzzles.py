# 4. remove instances of nil AND false from an array

# 5. don't reverse the array, but reverse every word inside it. e.g.
# ['dog', 'monkey'] becomes ['god', 'yeknom']

# 6.given an array of student names, like ['Bob', 'Dave', 'Clive']
# give every possible pairing - in this case:
# [['Bob', 'Clive'], ['Bob', 'Dave'], ['Clive', 'Dave']]
# make sure you don't have the same pairing twice,
